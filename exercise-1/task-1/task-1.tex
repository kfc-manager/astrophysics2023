\section*{1. Elliptical orbits}

a) Consider a planet on an elliptical orbit around the Sun, with semimajor axis $a$ and numerical 
excentricity $\epsilon$. Derive a formula for the maximum and the minimum distance of the planet to the
Sun, given $a$ and $\epsilon$.\\
\\
b) Kepler's second law states that the orbital speed on an elliptical orbit varies in a systematic way.
Derive a formula similar to a), but now for the maximum and the minimum orbital speed.\\
\\
c) Calculate the ratio between the maximum and the minimum
